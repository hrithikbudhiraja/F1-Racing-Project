### About F1
Formula 1 is an annual, global motorsport championship. It involves high-speed races between single-seat, open-wheel cars. These races, called Grands Prix, occur on dedicated race tracks and street circuits worldwide. Teams compete for both Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships across a season. The events span several days, including practice, qualifying, and the final race.
